Hi! I'm a Principal Machine Learning Engineer at Red Hat, where I work on projects to ensure large language models and AI agents are safe, reliable, and aligned with human values.

Over the past 20 years I've built production ML systems serving millions of users. I led technical implementations for major enterprise customers at Hugging Face, founded the Knowledge Graph team at Nextdoor, developed ML systems for user growth at Instacart, and scaled engineering teams at Unata (a Toronto startup that was acquired by Instacart).

I was a Fulbright Scholar and research fellow at MIT, and earned my engineering degrees from the University of Illinois in Chicago and Universidad Blas Pascal in beautiful CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. Back home, I learned my most valuable skill: how to prepare a great asado.
