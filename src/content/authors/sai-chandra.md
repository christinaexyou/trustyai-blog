I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Red Hat, focusing on making GenAI systems safer, more transparent, and aligned with responsible AI principles. My work spans explainability, robustness, and red-teaming LLMs to ensure they behave as intended—even when prompted otherwise.

I specialize in natural language processing, with particular interest in retrieval, representation learning, and language models ranging from compact SLMs to hefty LLMs. I’m especially curious about how these models/systems behave under adversarial pressure, and how we can build resilient safeguards that actually hold up.

I hold a Master's in Computer Science from Northeastern University in Boston, where I conducted research on the security and privacy of LLMs in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Outside of work, you’ll find me on a spontaneous road trip or chugging questionable amounts of coffee.
