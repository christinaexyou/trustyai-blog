I'm a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, working on the TrustyAI project.
I'm a core contributor to TrustyAI and serve as the community lead for the project.

I'm interested in the overlaps of statistical methods and artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on AI safety and trustworthy AI systems. I do research on and build tools to help make AI models more reliable, interpretable, and fair. This includes work on uncertainty quantification, model explainability, bias detection and mitigation, and robust evaluation methodologies for AI systems.

My background includes a PhD in Bayesian Statistics from Newcastle University, a Master's degree in Cloud Computing also from Newcastle University, and I've worked at Imperial College, London.
